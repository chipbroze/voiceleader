Voiceleader
===========
VoiceLeader is a work in progress.

Eventually, this little app should allow music theory teachers and students to input short SATB voiceleading exercises for evaluation.  It could also possibly allow users to generate short music compositions (with or without errors).

Input
-----
The app currently supports a very rudimentary input system created with html/javascript.  The homepage contains a set of 4 staves (soprano, alto, tenor, bass).  Clicking on any staff adds a note to that staff.  The arrow keys can move notes up and down, and can move between notes with left and right.  The delete key also works.  The user can input up to 10 notes per voice part, and sharps and flats can be added with the + and - keys.  Clicking the button "Fill Pitches" will fill the associated input fields with the pitch classes of the notes entered above.  Users can also type pitch classes directly into the input fields for greater flexibility.

Voiceleading
------------
The app will eventually support a wide range of voiceleading error-checkers.
